# Stranded!

## The scenario
A space ship crashed on an unknown planet.
You are Captain, the immortal AI core of the ship.
Your mission is to get your people home, and now that means guiding the survivors to build up an industrial civilization so they can build a new space ship.

## The gameplay
Time advances by years.
Each year, you get an Event where you have to make a choice or solve some problem, and after that you set your people's main priority for the year.
There will be several factions (scientists, farmers, educators, police...) all telling you that their project is the most important and urgent.
Every choice will affect your civilization's stats in technology, development, resources, faction power, etc.

## The scope
Starting with a few hundred survivors effectively thrown back to the stone age, guide them over centuries to a world-spanning and then interplanetary civilisation, until they can make contact with Earth again.

## The reality
None of this is implemented yet.
